## AI-Based-Evolutionary-Optimization 
This project combines physics simulation (Box2D), evolutionary algorithms, and AI techniques to solve a continuous dynamic optimization problem.
I implemented a Genetic Algorithm to evolve a chain of articulated segments and experimented with CMA-ES to compare optimization strategies in non-linear environments.
Additionally, I used neural networks as policy approximators to analyze patterns learned during the evolutionary process.
